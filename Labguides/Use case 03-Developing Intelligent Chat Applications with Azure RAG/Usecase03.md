## Use case 03-Developing Intelligent Chat Applications with Azure RAG

**Introduction**

This sample demonstrates a few approaches for creating ChatGPT-like
experiences over your own data using the Retrieval Augmented Generation
pattern. It uses Azure OpenAI Service to access the ChatGPT model
(gpt-35-turbo), and Azure Cognitive Search for data indexing and
retrieval.

The repo includes sample data so it's ready to try end to end. In this
sample application we use a fictitious company called Contoso
Electronics, and the experience allows its employees to ask questions
about the benefits, internal policies, as well as job descriptions and
roles.

This use case you through the process of developing a sophisticated chat
application using the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern on
the Azure platform. By leveraging Azure OpenAI Service and Azure
Cognitive Search, you will create a chat application that can
intelligently answer questions using your own data. This lab uses a
fictitious company, Contoso Electronics, as a case study to demonstrate
how to build a ChatGPT-like experience over enterprise data, covering
aspects such as employee benefits, internal policies, and job roles.

**Summary**

In this lab, you’ve learned how to set up and deploy an intelligent chat
application using Azure's suite of tools and services. Starting with the
installation of essential tools like Azure CLI and Node.js, you’ve
configured your development environment using Dev Containers in Visual
Studio Code. You've deployed a chat application that utilizes Azure
OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Search to answer questions from PDF files.
Finally, you’ve deleted the deployed resources to effectively manage
resources. This hands-on experience has equipped you with the skills to
develop and manage intelligent chat applications using the Retrieval
Augmented Generation pattern on Azure.
